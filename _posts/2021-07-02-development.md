### This three-part research project was initiated from a product selected from a local Albert Heijn–in this case, a sack of potatoes. The research covered the provenance of the product, the document influenced the related spaces attached to its supply chain, and the building type encountered in the supply chain where architectural parameters are at stake.

### As one of the most essential and heavily consumed produce in the Netherlands, the supply chain of potatoes spans the entire European continent. Therefore, the study on provenance revealed meticulous planning in spaces, infrastructures, and territories. Meanwhile, to facilitate such an enormous quantity of potatoes, the pricing label plays a crucial role within the supply chain. From self-adhesive sticker to electronic labeling system, price tag catalyzes the exponential growth in the floor area of food retailing. And last but not least, the Dutch auction house–a type of wholesale market name under an idiosyncratic trading method–indicates the development in potato trading and changes in the country's rural landscape design.
